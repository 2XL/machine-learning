how when and why of building a machine learning solution with python.

Install requirements
-

```bash
pip-compile
pip-sync
```

What is machine learning?
-

building models from example inputs to make data driven predictions vs following strictly static program instructions.

machine learning workflow

1. asking the right question
2. preparing data
    tidy data: tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure:
        - each variable is a column
        - each observation is a row
        - each type of observational unit is a table.
3. selecting the algorithm
    - use solutions statement to filter algorithms
    - discuss best algorithms
    - select one initial algorithm
4. training the model
5. testing the model
